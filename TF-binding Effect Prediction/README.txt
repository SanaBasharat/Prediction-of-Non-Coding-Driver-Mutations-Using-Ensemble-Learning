Firstly, run the TF_model.py file if you don't have already pre-computed parameters ( you can download the necessary TF-train files from the/data folder on the GitHub Repo. ) 

You can skip this step if you want to use pre-computed parameter files in the /TF_outputs folder. 

Secondly, run the Pred_multiproc py file to obtain predictions of TF-binding effects (for different alpha threshold values).
