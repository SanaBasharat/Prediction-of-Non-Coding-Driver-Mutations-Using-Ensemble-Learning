Firstly, run TF_model.py file if you dont have already pre-computed parameters ( you can download necessaray TF-train files from /data folder on the GitHub Repo. ) 

You can skip this step if you want to use pre-computed parameter files on the /TF_outputs folder. 

Secondly, run Pred_multiproc py file to obtain predictions of TF-binding effects (for different alpha thresold values).
