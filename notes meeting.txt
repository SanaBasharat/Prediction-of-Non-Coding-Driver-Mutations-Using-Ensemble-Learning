supplementary note 5

OncodriveCLUSTL actually is not applied to non-coding mutations

Pathway and network analysis of more than 2500 whole cancer genomes
This focuses more on genes, rather than individual mutations

OncoDriveFML
It focuses on coding and non coding driver regions rather than specific mutations
