Dr. Nod - non-coding drivers found
Supplementary table S4

may have found ref and alt with coordinates for rheinbay 2020
supplementary table 9: Significant bins in genome-wide analysis
supplementary note 5

OncodriveCLUSTL actually is not applied to non-coding mutations

Pathway and network analysis of more than 2500 whole cancer genomes
This focuses more on genes, rather than individual mutations

OncoDriveFML
It focuses on coding and non coding driver regions rather than specific mutations

_______

Write draft for student award

have a meeting with Hilmi about how to run his code for the test data
based on the mutation's cancer type, use the closest file
have a list of all files

TODO after workshop:
_____
mirna.gff from Mirbase
it shows which mutations fall into mirna regions (that's also important)
https://mirdb.org/index.html
https://www.targetscan.org/vert_80/
https://mirbase.org/download/   hsa.gff3

CHECK ASSEMBLY AS WELL

Use the columns that have mirna in them (mature) with 21 nucleotides
not mirna_primary_transcript

use mirna, not mirna primary
prediction tool to see if mutation falls into a utr region that mirna binds with
then check whether after mutation the mirna binds with it or not
"Mature sequences have type "MiRNA""

you can use mirdb as prediction database
targetscan (see for more understanding)
2nd to 8th nucleotide
but if first is 'A', they are including that as well

check against "reverse compliment" of mirna sequence
non-canonical matches are possible (not all of mirna has to match)

our non-coding mutations MUST suppress TP53 (our results should be this)

https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1629-z

MIRDB: (see its paper as well and where we can download this data)
if it falls into 3 utr region (black) then 1, if it falls in actual blue region, then 2
also make use of target scores

____
try to generate a column for long non coding rna
look for tools for this
